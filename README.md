# LmdbJava

LmdbJava provides an extremely low latency
[JNR-FFI](https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi)-based binding to the
[LMDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) native library. LMDB is an ultra-fast,
ultra-compact, b-tree ordered, embedded, key-value store developed by Symas for
the OpenLDAP Project.

LMDB uses memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance of a pure in-memory
database while still offering the persistence of standard disk-based databases.
It is transactional with full ACID semantics and crash-proof by design.
No journal files. No corruption. No startup time. No dependencies. No config
tuning. LMDB is the perfect foundation for large, read-centric, single node
workloads that require strong latency and operational robustness outcomes.

### Installation

Windows, Linux and OS X users can simply add the LmdbJava JAR to their classpath
and start using the LmdbJava API (we bundle the LMDB libraries inside the JAR).
If you prefer to use a shared system library, set the `lmdbjava.disable.extract`
[Library](https://github.com/lmdbjava/lmdbjava/tree/master/src/main/java/org/lmdbjava/Library.java) property to `true`.

Other operating systems will need to install the LMDB system library separately.
The standard operating system package manager will likely work, but if you'd
rather an up-to-date, tested, better-supported integration, try adapting the
[LmdbJava Native](https://github.com/lmdbjava/native) cross-compile targets.

### Usage

Have a read through the
[tutorial](https://github.com/lmdbjava/lmdbjava/tree/master/src/test/java/org/lmdbjava/TutorialTest.java)
to learn how to use LmdbJava.

### Support

any questions.

### History

For years Java users have been able to access LMDB via
[LMDBJNI](https://github.com/deephacks/lmdbjni). Its public API is mature and
widely used, but this makes it challenging to implement any substantial changes.

LmdbJava was created to provide a new LMDB abstraction without the backward
compatibility consideration. A separate project also offered a convenient
opportunity to implement many internal changes to reduce latency and long-term
maintenance costs. For example, we moved from HawtJNI to JNR-FFI (for its active
community, lower latency, Java 9 roadmap and much simpler build requirements). We
also significantly reduced and isolated `Unsafe` use, with only a single method
now requiring it (and there is an automatic reflective fallback if `Unsafe` isn't
available). Overall these changes make LmdbJava the optimal choice for projects
targeting server-class JVMs, and it will be easy to support Java 9 when released.
