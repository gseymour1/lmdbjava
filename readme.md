# LMDB Java

LMDB Java provide a Java API to [LMDB](http://symas.com/mdb/) which is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact key-value embedded data store developed by Symas for the OpenLDAP Project. It uses memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance of a pure in-memory database while still offering the persistence of standard disk-based databases. Transactional with full ACID semantics and crash-proof by design. No corruption. No startup time. Zero-config cache tuning. No dependencies. Proven in production applications.
